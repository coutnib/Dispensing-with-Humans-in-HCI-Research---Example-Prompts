DISCUSSION:

1. Relationshiop between humanlikeness and perceived threats: We found a signifcant relationship between humanlikeness and perceived threats. However, we found that the online community more frequently perceived moderately humanlike robots, rather than highly humanlike robots, as posing a threat to jobs and humanity. 

2. Threat to humanity: Moreover, threat to humanity was the most prevalent topic in comments responding to moderately humanlike robots. The association between references to robots threatening jobs and safety and negative comment valence suggests that the perception of threats is associated with a negative attitude to robots.

3. Previous work: Our results contrast with previous studies which found that more humanlike robots are perceived as more threatening than less humanlike robots or found no association. 

These conficting results may be due to the use of different  methodologies, but they may also indicate that the relationship between humanlikeness and perceived threats is highly complex. It is possible that dispositional or contextual factors, such as the way robots were portrayed in the videos, influence perceived threat.
