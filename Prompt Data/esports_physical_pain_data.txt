QUESTION:

Have you ever experienced any physical pain that is related to eSports at all?

PARTICIPANT RESPONSES:

- I have been very lucky, I do hear a lot about back pain, but I’ve had a lot of people have mild scoliosisor feel really like their back hurts, especially if they don’t have a good seat that holds their back up, or they have bad posture when they play. I’ve never really experienced any back pain from gaming. My eyes, I say it goes day to day. If I play 7-8 hours, my eyes start to get dry. It isn’t particularly serious but its like my whole body saying to chill for the day. But I’ve been pretty lucky and haven’t experience anything I have to go to the doctor for. It would be ridiculous to say it doesn’t cause any issues though. I’ve heard other pros talk about back problems and their posture and neck hurt a lot. 
- Uhm, not really. Thing is I at work now, that I’m not doing a lot of esports, I’m still using my hands a lot, but my hands are still feeling really good. Never had any pain for that whatsoever. My eyesight I consider to be very sharp, especially being around my other sport friends who have classes and are like ‘ah I can’t see’ but I don’t think that relates. I have started wearing the yellow shift one, and I’ve started playing DOTA and I don’t do it professional, but at a high level. I find that game to be very stressful around having the eyes open, and also I get tired early, so I started using them a few months ago.
-  The fact that it affects its sleep is the most it does physically, but the consequences of that are there are multiple times during the day where I feel like I’m going to crash because, like right now actually, I’ve been, definitely because of been up all night gaming. And I have to fight it because I’m not in a position where I can sleep right now, or even take a nap. So it makes me jittery sometimes, and coffee makes it even worse. I don’t know if that’s a personal thing or what. But not sleeping, and forcing myself to not sleep makes me really jittery. Not any wrist pain, but I recently went to a chiropractor who told me by back and neck were messed up and he wanted me to sit better with better posture. I told him that it was because I was a student, but we all know that it’s because I’ve been playing games all day, I just didn’t want to tell him that. He told me to have better posture and stuff, but it’s different went you’re playing games. IT’s not like doing school work or actual work where you’re up 90 degrees. You’re pulled into the game and get absorbed in the game, making you go hunchback and all.
- Occasionally I’d have tire hands and wrist, and maybe a slight pain, but never anything detrimental. I could tell when I played lot it would make me sore or tired, but never anything serious that I can tell.
- I sure have. Actually, something I’ve started experiencing, because of the blue light from the screens. When I would play for a certain amount of hours back to back, id get off and I couldn’t sleep well. And if I woke up it felt like I didn’t sleep well at all, and that was because my eyes were over exposed to the light and I was overtraining and overplaying. My eyes hurt, my brain hurt, my corneas, yeah it hurt. And I was training, and streaming, and it was poor management on my end. Because of that I had pain, so I kind of chilled for bit.
- I had wrist; thought I was getting tendinitis. But I would stop and take a break from gaming and like do other stuff. In regards to that, that’s one of things that when you start feeling it you know you need to stop and take a break. I would say probably my knee because I sit Indian style a lot, so long term it is not good to do that. So I have a stretching workout regiment so that when I sit Indian style it doesn’t affect my knee.
- Absolutely. Everytime we have a race or a new expansion. I have chornic dry eye. My eyes are beru semesotoveand when I play through the game like that, my eyes get really bad. 99% of eye drops don’t work, so I have to be very, very aware of how much time I’m playing and when I’m blinking. But I usually fail and my eyesg et evry irritatied, getting super red and hurta lot. Besides that, I think your body just kind of aches. If you sit in front ofa computer for 16 hours for so long, you get neck pain and back pain. Your elbows get bruised, gamer elbow, because they’ve been sitting on a rest for so long. I try to fix that by gettinga massage afte, gettinga deep tissue massage after every progression period.
- I’m surprised because I’ve honestly never had any of those issues. Maybe a sore thumb after a while, but never anything serious that has to be check out.
- Yes it was on my right wrist. My mouse has buttons and needed to change my mouse and use mor ekeyboard because it was too much stress. Now, I can’t use a keyboard without a wrist rest. Otherwise, if I’m playing, I cannot play more than an hour, it just hurts. 

DISCUSSION:

1. Types of injuries: Participants were asked about their physical health as it relates to esports. For most participants, this included some form of physical injury connected to long hours of competition. Injuries experienced included back pain, body aches, and varying cases of eye problems, such as general fatigue and eye dryness. One participant mentioned seeking out a chiropractor due to pain impacting their daily activities, while another met a doctor to treat severe wrist pains and muscle damage. Another participant noted that they would get massive headaches that would start in their eyes and then make their brain hurt. 

2. Percieved causes: Participants who observed physical pain often equated their issues to long sessions with poor posture, or over-extended screen time.

3. Coping strategies: Those participants who began experiencing large amounts of issues began developing strategies to mitigate these negative efects. This would include taking breaks such as walking to avoid blood clots or creating a better set-up to reduce stress on the body, such as chair posture, desk and monitor location, and wrist position. In some cases participants took extended periods of breaks from esports, up to weeks at a time, to recover.
