QUESTION:

What kind of Support do you have? Have you been on a team with a mental coach?

PARTICIPANT RESPONSES:

- Well in smite teams have not done it for the most part. They’re just general coaches. Whatever the coach wants to do, and they want to watch your games and tell what you did wrong that’s mostcommon. But some coaches are better than others at talking to players about how they feel and helping people resolve feelings and basically be good. Like Pete salalney, has been good about talking to us. He tries to be quite good with asking about how people feel and not letting people be too silent, or get out without talking through their mindset. I don’t even know what an organization could do without havingstraight up mental coach. But there’s only room for six people: five players and a coach, and the coach is a gameplay coach with strategy and play over anything else.
- for sure. Having a strong mind set and feeling strong and comfortable helps your mindset and it’s the best mindset you could have. I think having someone who knows the psychology and mind set of athletes would help a lot. There aren’t many coaches who can do that or don’t have much qualifications for that kind of stuff, but there is no doubt in my mind it would help a lot. Having healthy mindsets in players is just as important as physical bodies, if not more important in video games.
- Well there’s always people on the team your closer too that you can vent to and talk to. But I had one guy, that goes back to when I was kicked from the team. There was one guy on the team that I had good synergy with, that I could always talk to. He basically said you have one more tryout, you have to play better. You have more chance and well see how it goes. I was at a bad time at that point, my gf had broken up with me too. So I went to a psychologist because it was overwhelmed by everything, I’mbeing kicked and romantic life is bad. The psychologist told me to double down on my strength. So I told this guy I want to be better at my thing, and I want to show you guys. He said I don’t think so, you should work on the new stuff. And the next day there’s no tryout and you’re just kicked right away. And I thought I had a solution to the problem but I didn’t and that was sad. Because you have these emotional impactful connections on your team, and that kind of cut out for me at the end, which is unlucky. Rough day. Organization as well?
- I guess, one thing, despite the social aspect, I’ve made a lot of good friendships through SC. There are people I talk to on a daily basis that I met through the community. Having someone to share that with, especially when you are an active player, like we are all in it together and doing this crazy stupidly hard game at a high level for no reason than our own self-gratification. If you want to be making a good living, you won’t be playing esports. There is a real bonding that comes together over that. It makes it easy to talk to people in that type of thing, and the self-motivation. Its issues that a lot of these players go through. Outside of the scene, I’ve had a relatively very supportive family. IF they saw a great future,they would have been very supportive. I never reached the point where it felt like a great career option, so it limited that object.
- I sure did [find help independently], [it was] all me.
- For me, its my wife, 100%. She actually drove out during the reace twice and was there whenever we foguth the boss. Shes a great partner in all of this and it helps me a lot having her there.
- It is definitely a combination between my gf and parents. I met her just when I made world and regional finals, and she thought it was pretty cool and kinda funny. Then when she realized the money I make, she really jumped on board. My parents were always against it, but once I started making money they became much more supportive.
- My mom. My dad was so against it, but my mom said whatever makes you happy, do it. If I needed money or anything, she wanted me to ask and just do it. I showed my mom where I Was, how good I was, and she just said ok, what do you need? My mom was the biggest support. [The team] gave us merchandise but that was it. They were on times with payments and they have loke, consulting if you ask. But you have to ask because they don’t tell you they actually have it. Riot Games and Blizzard gave some support. Riot games cared about players, making sure I’m travelling andeveruything is ok with customs and hotel and everything. But Blizzard didn’t give a fuck. Riote would give the team baskets at the hotel, and hire a shuttle to get you around, everywhere. Thjey were amazing. 

DISCUSSION:

1. Family and friends: One of the main sources of support was reported as family members and friends (i.e., parents, signifcant others, a close group of friends, etc.). Many participants talked about the visual support their family and friends showed as active members of the audience at important matches, driving to diferent events with the participants, or just being in the area during practices. Additionally, they would provide listening and emotional support to participants during hard times, such as going through a change of teams, or facing symptoms of depression. In one participant's experience, a major factor in the symptoms of mental illness was the lack of support and community in esports. Because competitions, streaming, and tournaments were all conducted virtually, human interaction was minimal. The computer element dehumanized the communication and sense of togetherness provided in team atmospheres or traditional sports.

2. Teams and organizations: By contrast, participants generally commented that the teams and sponsors did not provide any form of physical or emotional support during the players’ time as professionals. One player believed it was due to money, with smaller teams lacking the necessary funds to provide legitimate supportive services for them. However, other players admitted that even if they had resources from their teams available to them, they were unsure if they would reach out and use them. Still, players noted that they would have liked a form of a mental coach, or connections beyond just a team captain. Many of the players entering the esports professional scene are young individuals, and mentioned having better support is crucial. Because of this lack of support, those who received professional aid had to fnd the assistance on their own. Their time and resources were used to fnd some form of doctor or psychologist that could provide assistance in handling the psychological stress and damage they were experiencing through their time as a professional esports player. In their experience, participants said there was a complete lack of resources or advice surrounding how to handle their psychological wellness, or what to expect should it begin to deteriorate.
