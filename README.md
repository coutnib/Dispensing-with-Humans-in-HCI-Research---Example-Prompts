# Dispensing-with-Humans-in-HCI-Research---Example-Prompts
In this repository you will find example prompts that can be used on many text-generation large language models. 
'One-shot.txt' contains a blank one-shot prompt template that can be filled in with either data from prompt_data/ or data from another source.
'ChatGPT.txt' contains a blank ChatGPT prompt template.

prompt_data/ contains sets of data that can be used to fill in the prompt templates to try out this approach on real data.

Some models available for use in this approach are:

ChatGPT:
https://chat.openai.com/chat
(free, no hyperparameter options, only one model option)

GPT-3:
https://beta.openai.com/overview
(requires account and usage fees, yes hyperparameter options, multiple models)

Jurassic:
https://www.ai21.com/studio
(requires account and usage fees, yes hyperparameter options, multiple models)

How to Use:
To use our prompts, simply copy and paste one into your desired option and hit `generate.' 
Feel free to substitute your own data to see how well it performs.  
We are, unfortunately, unable to make our fine-tuned model or our entire dataset freely available at this time.

This repository may be periodically updated and added to.
